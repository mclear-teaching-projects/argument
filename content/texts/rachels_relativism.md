> There is no reason to think that there are any absolute moral truths. We
> can see this when we consider different cultural outlooks concerning
> what is morally required. For example, indigenous Inuit culture
> considered infanticide to be morally permissible in some situations. But
> modern American culture clearly thinks infanticide is always morally
> wrong. So what's morally right or wrong is just a matter of opinion,
> which can vary from culture to culture. (James Rachels, *The Elements of
> Moral Theory*)
