## Text

> There are, moreover, seemingly unanswerable arguments that, if they are

> the existence of free will, and, therefore, if free will does not exist,
> moral responsibility does not exist either. It is, however, evident that
> moral responsibility does exist: if there were no such thing as moral
> responsibility nothing would be anyone's fault, and it is evident that
> there are states of affairs to which one can point and say, correctly,
> to certain people: That's your fault. (van Inwagen “How to Think”)

## Sample Extraction

1. If there were no such thing as moral responsibility, then no one
   would be at fault for anything
2. But people do correctly fault others for performing certain kinds of
   actions
3. $\therefore$ There is moral responsibility
4. If there were no free will, then there would be no moral
   responsibility
5. There is moral responsibility (from 3)
6. $\therefore$ There is free will


## Schematization

1. If ~A, then ~B
2. B
3. $\therefore$ A (by 1, 2, modus tollens)
4. If ~C then ~A
5. A (from (3))
6. $\therefore$ C (by 4,5, modus tollens)
