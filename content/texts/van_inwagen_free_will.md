> There are, moreover, seemingly unanswerable arguments that, if they are
> correct, demonstrate that the existence of moral responsibility entails
> the existence of free will, and, therefore, if free will does not exist,
> moral responsibility does not exist either. It is, however, evident that
> moral responsibility does exist: if there were no such thing as moral
> responsibility nothing would be anyone's fault, and it is evident that
> there are states of affairs to which one can point and say, correctly,
> to certain people: That's your fault. (van Inwagen “How to Think”)
